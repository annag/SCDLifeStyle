`TKCoverflowView` imitates the coverflow you’d find in the iPod/Music app on the iPhone OS. Coverflow displays `TKCoverflowView` objects. This view functions similar to the `UITableView` where covers that are off screen aren’t loaded until need. Thus, similar to the tableview, you can dequeue a cover view and hand it back to Coverflow View using the data source.
